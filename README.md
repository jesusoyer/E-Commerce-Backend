## Description

Allows the user to do Crud operations through sequelize to manipulate a sql database. For a user wanting to have a more strait forward way of manipulating
data in real time. This program solves the issue of needing to turn the server on and off in order to manipulate data, and is using javascript to create the 
connection as well as manipulate data. I learned how to do Crud operation through different routes to connect with a sql data base through sequelize.
